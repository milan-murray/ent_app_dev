/*
Shape class
    1. Implement a Shape class which stores the color (e.g. red, blue etc.) of a Shape. 
    2. Implement a constructor to set the color for the shape. 
    3. Implement appropriate properties for the class.
    4. Implement 2 methods in Shape, one to return details of the Shape (ToString() ) and one to allow a shape to be translated in 2D space (Translate(..)). The amount to be translated should be passed as a parameter to the translate methodÂ (as a reference to a Vertex object i.e. the amount the object is to be translated with respect to the X and Y axes). 
    5. Test the Shape class. 

Line class
    1. Implement a Line class as a subclass of Shape. A line is to represented by 2 vertices (the endpoints for the line). Implement a constructor for Line which take 5 parameters indicating the x and y coordinates of each vertex and the color of the line.
