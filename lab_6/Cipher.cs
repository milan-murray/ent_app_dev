/*
	A system is required which allows for different ciphers to be used to encrypt plaintext messages into ciphertext. 
	Use a delegate to define a set of methods which take a plaintext message as input and return a ciphertext message. 

	Implement two different ciphers which can be plugged and played via the delegate. 
	The first cipher should be a simple Caeser cipher which shifts up every character in the plaintext by one character position. 
	The second cipher should just reverse the plaintext to form the ciphertext.
